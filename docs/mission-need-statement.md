### 1. Statement of Mission Needs

#### Goal 1.1 - Design of Drone
As a team, develop and produce a design of a small fixed-wing drone that meets all requirements, and delivers a design by chosen deadline.  

#### Goal 1.2 - Original Design
The team will design a completely original design, not using step-by-step guides, but rather from detailed research and design methods.

#### Goal 1.3 - Team Integration
As a team of multidisciplinary engineering/computer science students utilization of each member's skills and knowledge will be done, to produce a robust design.

#### Goal 1.4 - Cost of Drone
The total cost of design, manufacturing, and testing will remain at a minimum. With a target under $200.

#### Goal 1.5 - Flight of Drone
The team will design a drone that can takeoff, maintain steady level flight and land in a short time period. 

#### Goal 2.1 - Structure Design
The design of the structure will be robust inorder to meet all flight requirements, as well as minimizing both cost and weight, and be integrated with all subsystems.

#### GOAL 2.2 - Aero Design
The design of the aerostructures will generate adequate lift, but focus on reducing the manufacturing difficulty. While having interaction with the structure system. 

#### Goal 3.1 - Software Design
As a team, deliver a software package that is robust, and responsive to user input. The software will be integrate with the electronics package.

#### Goal 3.2 - Electronics Package
The team will design an electronics package that will allow for maxim performance at a minimum to cost and weight. As well as integrating seamlessly with both structures and software systems.

### 2. Capability Gap & Mission Need

Currently we are a team that consists of three students with different majors, and backgrounds. One student is studying aerospace engineering, one computer engineering, and one computer science. The team will work to design a fixed-wing drone to improve each member's technical and communication skills. Each member will have an opportunity to challenge their current knowledge. Also members will be able to learn and see how different disciplines of engineering operate. A successful fight is not the true measure of success of the mission. Members growing technical skills and team skills to produce and manufacture a design the targeted mission success. 

The team composition is highly focused on the software development side of engineering. This leads to a gap in the team's needs as all flight dynamics, aerodynamics, structures, and flight controls are controlled by a single member, with no capability to verify technically correct work of these subsystems with other team members. There is not an easy work around to this issue. 

This is a project that does not take priority of school, work, and other personal obligations therefore will be slowed greatly during the school year. The project will be worked on when members have free time to dedicate.

The team will use members' apartments to conduct a majority of the design and manufacturing process. The team will also use all existing resources at their disposal such as, arduino, balsa wood, and other materials.

### 3. Potential Approach

#### 3.1 - Potential Approach
The potential approach for design:
* Formulate a new design

A detailed analysis will not be conducted as there is only one potential approach. Mission requirements and resources available box the team into formulating a new design. There is not a previous inderation to modify, and a major requirement is to formulate an original design to the team. 


#### 3.2 - Limitations

The team is based out of Ames Iowa and this puts a constraint on flight testing locations. Another location limitation is the manufacturing location will be an apartment without access to power tools. No access to power tools massively increases the importance of having an easy to produce design.

The schedule for the project, talked more about in section 4.2, is to have a working prototype by june. The team will have school until May which means work time on the project will be minimal. 

The team's knowledge is focused on software development. This leads to a bottle neck with all non software capabilities of the drone. All these capabilities will fall on one member of the team. 

### 4. Resource and Schedule Forecast

#### 4.1 Cost Forecast

| Item | Cost |
| ---- | ---- |
| Electronics | $50-$70 |
| Structures | $20-$80 |
| Other | $0-$20 |


Electronics include anything that is connected to the battery, and Structures are for wood, landing gears, glue. Other includes a buffer for unknown cost such as shipping, paint, etc.

**Total Cost: $70-$170**

#### 4.2 Schedule Forecast
