### Project Updates
The purpose of this document is to share any updates in the project. To give the team a better understanding of what members have done in the past, and changes in project directions. From major design changes to small part replacements. 

#### New 3D CAD Model - 4/11/2022 (Spencer)
The previous designs and builds of the aircraft were suboptimal. I wanted to start designing an improved structure that would reduce weight, and frontal area. A reduction in weight will improve overall aircraft performance. A reduction in frontal area will reduce drag. This also involved creating an airfoil for the aircraft. This new airfoil will have an increased cord length, and look a little like a parallelogram. These new changes have the aim to increase the performance of the wing. This is just a preliminary model and will be modified and changed with further analysis.  

#### New Transceiver - 4/12/2022 (Spencer)
I bought a new transceiver that was well reviewed for drone projects. I believe this improves workability, reliability, and accuracy of  the transmitters. Which is desperately needed. Also I included a transmitter with  a “Large” antenna which gives us a much greater range. There are two sets of transmitters, one that has a slot for an antenna and ones that do not. Other than that slot there is no difference between the two, they are the same model. You can find links to these in the [parts spreadsheet](./Parts.xlsx). 

#### More Documentation - 4/12/2022 (Spencer)
I’ve started to work on creating some documentation for this project. I created a mission needs statement so we can have a clear understanding of the project. That document is subject to change, and I would be grateful for all members' input on it. I’m also working on creating more documentation for the high-level design, and also lower level items as well. The goal of this is to make the project more “Formal”, so we can make a final report that can go into a portfolio if you would like. 

#### Configuring Repository and Site - 4/14/2022 (Christian)
I've revamped the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristianLisle/rc-drone) to include all of the latest documentation. In addition, I have configured the GitHub pages site to display all `md` and `pdf` files. The goal for this site is to contain all of the documents in an appropriate format and strongly represent the work completed in the upcoming months. The site will develop and improve as the project progresses. I will reach out to everyone shortly to discuss the possibilty of migrating the remaining `pdf` files to `md` for simplicity.
